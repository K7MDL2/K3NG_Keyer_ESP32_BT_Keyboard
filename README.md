# k3ng_cw_keyer
K3NG Arduino CW Keyer

The K3NG Keyer is an open source Arduino based CW (Morse Code) keyer with a lot of features and flexibility, rivaling commercial keyers which often cost significantly more. The code can be used with a full blown Arduino board or an AVR microcontroller chip can be programmed and used directly in a circuit. This keyer is suitable as a standalone keyer or for use permanently installed inside a rig, especially homebrew QRP rigs. Itâ€™s open source code so you can fully customize it to fit your needs and also perhaps learn from it or find coding ideas for other projects.

***********************  Oct 9, 2025  K7MDL *****************************
Update: Oct 29, 2025:  This is fully functional for the features I have defined.  Tested 3 BT keyboards.  The K380s is a BLE keyboard and curerntly does not reconnect so it required you to poair it each connection for now.  All keys for the equivalent PS2 keyboard are assigned.    See Wiki pages.
This requires certain settings.

There are 2 relevant bugs.  
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/15379  - BLE-HID-Device Re-Connection not working with the esp_hid_host (unresolved)
https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/12401  - HID Host fails to connect to a BLE keyboard (solved - see details of settings required)

These config values must be changed:
   
    #define CONFIG_BT_GATTC_NOTIF_REG_MAX 64  //needed for K380s BLE keyboard 
    #define CONFIG_BT_SMP_MAX_BONDS 40
    #define BTA_GATTC_CONN_MAX  64

    Working on enabled a LCD display.  This currently does not work if compiled under Arduino IDE.

3 years ago (2022) SP5IOU modied the K3NG Keyer Arduino code to support an ESP32.  This repository is forked from his repositiry at https://github.com/aimeiz/k3ng_cw_keyer-master_2022.  After changing the pin assignments it worked on my ESP32-WROOM-32 dev board.  I used the board described in this Wiki page https://github.com/K7MDL2/K3NG_Keyer_ESP32_BT_Keyboard/wiki/CPU-Module

I then integrated a BT Keyboard library from https://github.com/turgu1/bt-keyboard.  It is a bit different in that the ESP32 is a HID host connecting to a BT keyboard for input.  Most examples just convert a USB or PS2 keyboard to BT to connect to a PC.   

I am using ESP-IDF to compile.  Arduino32 is added as a component.  I first tried Arduino IDE but I was not able to get a BT classic keyboard (Logitech K380) to fully connect after it was discovered.  My BLE Rii i8+ keyboard worked fine though.  My BT_Keyboard test programs behaved the same.   I ported it to esp-idf and BT classic works proper as does the Rii.  Working on a solution to the K380s not reconnecting.

I was getting RTOS WDT warnings while dits and dahs were being sent, competing with the BT service task.   I put the main program loop and check_bt_keyboard() into their own RTOS tasks and the problem seems to be solved for now. Seem OK at 30WPM and 13WPM.  More testing required.

The BT keyboard translates BT key codes to match the PS2 keycodes and calls into the slightly modified PS2 keyboard function.  See the K3NG docs for USB\PS2 Keyboard commands. I have a copy of the BT keyboard commands on this Wiki page https://github.com/K7MDL2/K3NG_Keyer_ESP32_BT_Keyboard/wiki/BT-Keyboard-Key-Assignments.   Not all keys on a PS2/USB keyboard are present on these compact BT keyboards.   I may alter some of the key assignments over time.

Tested with BLE K380s and Rii i8+ mini keyboards, and the Logitech K380 which happens to use BT classic.

I plan to fork the orignal K2NG repo then merge my changes into it so that this benefit from the updates to the original.  Since this version is currently compiled under esp-idf framework, it is not likely to be accepted into the main repo.

I plan to add more WIKI pages here to show how I set up the IDE Tool options.  The BT_keyboard files are included as a component so there shoudl be no need to find and download libraries and component unlike in Arduino.  When someone does a clean install and compile this can be verified.

I provide precompiled firmware for your compatible CPU board using either of 2 tools so you do not have to compile the code, jsut upload the binary files and run it. There are Wiki pages about hardware, other info, and how to upload the firmeware:
